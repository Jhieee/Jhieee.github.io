# Scope funtions ?
Scope funtions 란 무엇일까 ? 이미 코틀린을 사용하시는분들은 익숙하겠지만 github 에 kotlin 소스만 보면 함수 뒤에 ?.
> The Kotlin standard library contains several functions whose sole purpose is to execute a block of code within the context of an object. When you call such a function on an object with a lambda expression provided, it forms a temporary scope. In this scope, you can access the object without its name. Such functions are called scope functions.
